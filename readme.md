## üß≠ Project Management Module ‚Äî ProjectHub API

This module powers the team collaboration features within **ProjectHub**, providing a robust, structured, and role-based access system for creating, managing, and collaborating on projects. It's designed to be a production-grade backend solution, demonstrating clean modular architecture and advanced role-based authorization.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Project Lifecycle Management:** Full CRUD operations supporting project creation, soft-deletion, and restoration.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements a two-layer authorization system:
  1.  **Global Role** (`admin`, `member`, `guest`) for API endpoint access.
  2.  **Project Role** (`owner`, `manager`, `member`) for in-project permissions.
- **Structured Collaboration:** Enables project owners and managers to invite members and assign specific project roles.
- **Integrated Membership:** Manages project members, their roles, and access rights within the project scope.
- **Security & Data Integrity:** Uses comprehensive middleware to enforce access control based on user status, project status, and project-specific role permissions.

## üîí Project Role-Based Permissions

Project roles strictly define what a user can do within a specific project. The access matrix is as follows:

| Role        | `RoleView` (View Project Details) | `ProjectEdit` (Edit Metadata) | `ProjectManage Members` | `Delete Project` (Soft Delete) |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Owner**   | ‚úÖ                                | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                      | ‚úÖ                             |
| **Manager** | ‚úÖ                                | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                      | ‚ùå                             |
| **Member**  | ‚úÖ                                | ‚ùå                            | ‚ùå                      | ‚ùå                             |

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints & Project Lifecycle

The Project Management module supports the following core project lifecycle endpoints:

| Step                   | Endpoint                          | Method | Description                                                                 | Authorization      |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **1. Create Project**  | `/projects`                       | `POST` | Creates a new project and automatically assigns the creator as the `owner`. | Authenticated User |
| **2. Add Members**     | `/projects/:id/members`           | `POST` | Adds new users to the project.                                              | `owner`, `manager` |
| **3. Manage Roles**    | `/projects/:id/members/:memberId` | `PUT`  | Promotes, demotes, or removes a member from the project.                    | `owner`, `manager` |
| **4. Soft Delete**     | `/projects/:id/delete`            | `PUT`  | Marks the project as inactive in the database.                              | `owner`            |
| **5. Restore Project** | `/projects/:id/restore`           | `PUT`  | Reactivates a soft-deleted project.                                         | `owner`            |

## üß© Data Relationships (Simplified Schema)

The module relies on a relational structure to manage users, projects, and collaboration data:

- **User** (Global Role) $\rightarrow$ **Project** (`ownerId` $\rightarrow$ `User.id`)
- **Project** $\rightarrow$ **ProjectMembers** (`userId`, `projectId`, `projectRole`)
- **Project** $\rightarrow$ **Tasks** (Upcoming) $\rightarrow$ **Comments** (Future)
